- Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage : 1-2 minutes
    - In the event of a planned or unplanned outage of your DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if you have enabled Multi-AZ. The time it takes for the failover to complete depends on the database activity and other conditions at the time the primary DB instance became unavailable. Failover times are typically 60â€“120 seconds. However, large transactions or a lengthy recovery process can increase failover time

- Minimum RTO for a single region outage : 15-30 mins
    - In the event of a complete region outage, one of the support staff needs to manually promote the read replica in the secondary region to the primary database, update the application DB url with the new one. If this happens at night, we should safely assume that it takes at-least 5-10 mins for someone to getup and login to AWS console, 10-20 mins to actually fix the issue.

- Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage : 0 mins
    - With the Multi-AZ configuration, we have a synchronous standby copy of the primary database, so there would be no loss of data.

- Minimum RPO for a single region outage : 0 mins
    - Since we have a complete read replica in another region, there would be no data loss
