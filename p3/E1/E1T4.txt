# Poor practice 1
InstanceProfileRole: Policy associated with c3-app-InstanceRole violates Least Privilege Access
  - allows full access to all S3 buckets.
  - should allow access to only the S3 bucket: cand-c3-free-recipes-****, and not any other S3 buckets including cand-c3-secret-recipes-****

# Poor practice 2
WebAppSG: Inbound rules are too open
  - It should allow requests coming from the ALB only.
  - Should not allow direct SSH to the web app server
    - Use AWS system manager if necessary

# Poor practice 3
RecipeWebServiceInstance: Does not reside in a private subnet even though the server is places behind an ALB

# Poor practice 4
S3BucketRecipesSecret: No server side encryption, anyone with access to account would be able to read the data
