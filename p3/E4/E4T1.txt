1. To prevent SSH bruteforce attack
  - Remove SSH password login from the web service instance
  - Move the web service instance into the private subnet
  - Update the WebAppSG to allow requests only from the load balancer.

2. Enable server side encryption in those S3 buckets with a KMS key, and access to that key shall be given to a role assigned to privileged business users only.
   So even if the instances can access S3, they would not be able to decrypt and read the file.
